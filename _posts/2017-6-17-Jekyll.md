Nothing related to the image, I just like blue very much.

Hi guys! I've been planning to start writing about coding-related stuff like forever, and finally, it's here. Yeah basically, I'm creating this blog to share my knowledge and improve my writing and thinking as well. It will also keep me tracked my coding progress.

By the way, I made this with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com). I'm inspired by one of my friend [Galuh](http://galuhsahid.github.io), check out her blog, she's so coolâ€“she's both traveler and coder, how can it be?!
